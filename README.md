This is one of my favorite python project, In this project you can convert any text into QR code.

## main.py 
main.py can convert upto 25-30 alphanumeric characters (including letters, numbers, and some symbols).

--- You can use the above program to convert any URL into QR Code.

## qr.py
qr.py can convert upto 3000 alphanumeric characters (including letters, numbers, and some symbols).

--- Please note that encoding 3,000 alphanumeric characters in a single QR code may result in a denser QR code and could make it more challenging to scan reliably. It's important to ensure that the QR code remains scannable under different conditions, such as varying lighting or scanning devices.
